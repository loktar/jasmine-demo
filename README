# Sample Jasmine setup
#
# Here are all the commands I ran to make this demo:

mkdir jasmine-demo
cd jasmine-demo

sudo bundle install

jasmine init
rake jasmine

# Then in a new terminal

cd jasmine-demo
ruby -rubygems server.rb

# You can also run all your jasmine specs using selenium with this command:

rake jasmine:ci
